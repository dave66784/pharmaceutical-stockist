  description: |
    REST API for managing pharmaceutical products, inventory, orders, and users.

    ## Authentication
    Most endpoints require a Bearer JWT token obtained via `/api/auth/login` or
    `/api/auth/verify-otp`. Include it as: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

    ## Registration Flow (Two-Step OTP)
    1. `POST /api/auth/send-otp` — submit registration details, receive OTP by email.
    2. `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` — confirm OTP to create account and receive JWT.
